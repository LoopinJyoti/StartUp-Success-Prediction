There's a natural inclination to speculate whether their funding decisions could be enhanced with data-driven algorithms guiding their investment terms and conditions negotiations. To explore this further, we intend to leverage data from diverse sources such as Kaggle, Crunchbase, and Data World. By analyzing datasets from these platforms, we aim to identify patterns and insights that could potentially improve investment decision-making processes. We also aim to determine if a particular start-up is bound for failure or success. Through this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing startup success and investor behavior and hopefully have our own start-up one day.\n","\n","Start up funding dataset : https://data.world/datanerd/startup-venture-funding\n","\n","Start up Success Rate Analysis https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithsherigar/startup-success-rate-analysis\n","\n","Unicorns https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/unicorn-startups\n","\n","Startup Success Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RW7z_l9FwndM"},"source":["First we decided to explore each dataset to see which variables would be the most appropriate for our use case."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NvfMSlKX-1EK"},"source":["# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fzHvw5Kl-6-e"},"source":["### DATASET 1 - CAX_Startup_Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xGsEQXfb-rjU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714787311908,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1000,"user":{"displayName":"Prachee Talwar","userId":"16501359407158269647"}},"outputId":"ba7a465f-15a2-4f58-de21-10f051dad7f3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sPUqhgwM-rmG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714787311909,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Prachee Talwar","userId":"16501359407158269647"}},"outputId":"cf3488f8-b06b-43ff-af30-3d7691713740"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(202, 116)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":108}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","dataset1=pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/95-885-T11-Project2/Datasets/CAX_Startup_Data.csv\")\n","dataset1.head()\n","dataset1.shape"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DHptVgfgAwln"},"source":["We already see that the dataset contains 116 columns and 116 columns seem like good features to predict the success of the start up but the no of rows are very less just 202.
